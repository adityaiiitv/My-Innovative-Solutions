I am currently working as a Software Engineer for Axxess.
I have previously worked as a Software Developer Intern for Unity Technologies and a Unity Developer at UT Dallas.
I have worked with Unity and VR based applications. I have worked with MyndVR on an Android and VR based application. I developed a 360 Video player in Unity.
I am currently working on an AR-based application to detect a 2D object and rotate and translate a Virtual 3D object in Unity.
I have completed my Masters(Computer Science) from The University of Texas at Dallas. I have interned at Atos where my task was C++ OpenCV programming.  
I also love working on the UI/UX part of the projects. I am familiar with C#, .NET, SQL and Visual Studio to create Winforms/.NET applications. 
I am currently looking for a full-time job starting in October 2019.

Unity:

struct vs class unity - pass by memory or pass by reference
coroutines unity
java memory leak
Texture and Mesh are not thread proof
Vertex shader - script that runs for each matrix, allows dev to allow transformation
Pixel shader - runs for each pixel after 3 vertices have been processed
Deferred lighting - If scene is large, if pixels are provided light then huge over head, in deferred lighting draw without light,
                    then give light to the pixels visible in scene, so faster
Visualization mode - gives you number of pixels rendered in an area, yellow to white are hot
Time.DeltaTime - smooth transition as FPS may vary from 40 to 60 FPS
Vector normalization before movement - so that there is uniform steps
For trigger, one of the colliding objects must have rigid body attached to it
Direct access to methods is faster than indirect methods

SQL
  1NF - atomic values
  2NF - no partial dependency on PK
  3NF - no transitive dependency
  BCNF - for each X->Y, X should be a super key
  4NF - no multi valued dependency
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ..........
  CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);   helps speeding up select and where but slows down data input

why do you want to be a game designer?
Experience with math based games - love bluff, tried poker, love card games, 3D calculation based games

  Char ch='B'
  If you want it to be const
  Then it should be
  Const char cch="A"

  How will you Lock an object so that only 1 thread can access it in java? 
    by synchronized keyword, snyced on an object
  1. What is polymorphism? What is static and dynamic polymorphism
    static - method overloading as done at compile tiem
    dynamic - method overriding, using virtual funtion, done at run time
  2. What is virtual functions?
    function in base class overrided in derived class
  3. What is vtable and vptr?
    vptr - hidden pointer in c++, when there are more than 1 virtual functions
    vtable - virtual function table, each row is a function pointer of a corresponding virtual function
  4. What are the type of design pattern? Explain it. Tell about subtype of that.
    general reusable solution to commonly occuring problem
  5. Which design pattern you have used in you project? How will you decide which design pattern to use where?
    never used
  6. What is singleton design
    only one instance of class
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/
  7. Write small fun for operator overloading for + operator
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm
  8. Why we use const in in prototype of operator overloading?
    it passes a pointer, and it does not want the parameter to be changed by the function
  9. class test {
        int funct( void ) const;
         };
  what it will return?
  ->There is a pointer to the object for which a function is called known as the 'this' pointer. By default the type of 'this' is X *const ( a constant pointer). The const keyword changes the type to const X *const ( a constant pointer to constant data ).
  10. Difference betn vector and list? How will u decide which one to use
    List is fast as it is not synchornized, vector is slow
    List uses Iterator, Vector uses iterator or enumerable
    List is not legacy(old) class, vector is
  11. You have a class called Math which having 2 virtual fun add(), sub(). How many vtable will be created for this class and how it looks like??
